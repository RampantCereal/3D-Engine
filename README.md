# 3D Engine
 C++ 3D engine with modern pipeline features
 
 Initially done as part of a course on modern computer graphics.
 The features of the engine are as follows:
 
 - Deferred Rendering pipeline (with an option to see all Gbuffers)
 - PBR
 - Directional, cone and point lights
 - Shadowmaps
 - Directional light with volumetric lighting
 - Reflections with probes and integrated into the scene with the PBR metallic coefficients
 - SSAO+ implementation
 - 2D Decals
